# CORTFOLIO
## Cortney Drummond's portfolio, developed using WordPress

[Link to the live portfolio](http://portfolio.cortneydrummond.com)

The code in this repository reflect www.cortneydrummond.dev, which is a fictitious URL used for local development. The live website is http://portfolio.cortneydrummond.com.
This portfolio uses the following concepts and technologies:

* WordPress child themes
* JavaScript/jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* PHP

While the portfolio features my web design and graphic design work, I am capable of WordPress and JavaScript development as well.

For this iteration, I sought to create a responsive, one-page layout that follows current trends, like hero images, parallax effects, and animations for user experience enhancement. Future iterations will (hopefully) implement technologies such as CSS Grid and Vue.js.
